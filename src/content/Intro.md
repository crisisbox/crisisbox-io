## What is Crisisbox?

### Crisisbox is a rapid response toolkit that makes it easier for volunteers to spontaneously organize to defend marginalized communities from legal threats in times of crisis.

Unlike commercially available alternatives like Google Docs, CrisisBox will provide an easy-to-deploy platform uniquely tailored to the needs of grassroots organizers, including protection from state-level surveillance.
