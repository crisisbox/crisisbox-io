## Motivation

On Jan 2017, a large number of lawyers rushed to JFK and other airports to help the people about the get caught in the executive order. We're creating Crisis-box to address that needs we felt that day:


   * Intake traveler's information into a secure document sharing system where lawyers can work collaboratively with other lawyers.
   * Make it possible to quickly and friction-less-ly share these documents with incoming volunteers, and remove access when volunteer leave the group, even when time happens hour-by-house. In crisis situations, there is central sysadmin who can do this work.
At nobanjfk, sensitive information found its way to Google Docs and other file sharing platform. Lawyers present agreed this had been necessary for expediency. But at the same time, they felt the security was not at all appropriate for lawyer work -- especially for work that is defending against government action, which are at risk of unconstitutional document seizures and surveillance.

Crisisbox will be different in these way:

   * It is easily deployable in a crisis. It comes with excellent document usable by non-techies.
   * It can be deployed on safe servers in safe country, has chosen by the lawers doing the work.
   * It can even be deployed on a machine present in the room where lawyer work is getting done, without an internet connection, for air-glap level security.
Crisisbox will also feature user management tailored to keep up with the quick, minute-per-minute intake-outtake of volunteer that occurs in the human right crisis situation.

[vision of broadening to more uses]
